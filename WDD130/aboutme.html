<p>Actually I live in Merida Yucatan, a place near from the cost, in the south of Mexico with my family. I´m 23 years old. I´m married, we just have like 8 months. I think my state is the hotest in all the country.</p>
<p>I served a full time mission in Mexico Chihuahua Mission, from 2016 to 2018</p>
<p>I am planning to get an apply technology degree.</p>
<p>I love music as well, I have studied music from 8 years old so now I'm working like a children music teacher</p>
