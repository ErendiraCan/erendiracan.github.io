        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I’m from Mexico and my sister and my mom make cakes and all kind of desserts. They sale them but just to the people who know them. I would like everyone could try their desserts because they are so good and the price is good and accessible. Normally
            asking a cake by internet it’s so expensive, so I would like to create a web site where they can sell cheaper desserts, no matter the quantity; because sometimes these pages just sell one piece or no more than 12, so in my website people will
            able to buy a cake or 50 cupcakes for a party. I just want to make a cheaper internet brand of cakes. I would like you could see how expensive the internet desserts are here to realize this is a good idea in my city. Well Sweet Sweet Home
            will be that website where Merida people will be able to buy good quality and prices desserts. They will be able to watch what we offer and contact my mom to make an order easily, cheaper and from home!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. One of the sister of my ward: I think this will be a good idea, and a good competition for the others brands who are in the market already.</li>
            <li>2. My aunt: Everyone will be in love with your mama desserts, and her cakes have a good price, compared with the other brands, it’s cheaper.</li>
            <li>3. My classmate: I really like your idea. I love homemade desserts. I always prefer homemade stuff better than the store ones. It is also always hard to find really good cakes or desserts. In my opinion, your website will have success.</li>

        <h3>Typography</h3>

        <p>I like this because it looks so stylish and cute as well, we will sell cakes so I think this font is perfect for that.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: EB Garamond</h4>
        <p>I chose this one because it is more simple, clear and easy to read for the information paragraphs but at the same time it matches with the heading font.</p>
