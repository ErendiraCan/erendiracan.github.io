        <p>After some months Eric wanted to take me to Cancun just to have fun and have a good time there like couple. One night we went to eat, the food was so good, of course because it was taquitos al pastor (Pastor tacos). After my sweetie told me he
            was looking for a good place to take us a pic. We walked a little looking for it, when we found it, a man (a tourist) were gonna take us a pic, I really thought it was a pic when Eric started to talk, I told him if he could wait after the
            pic but in that moment he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, I was super surprised. <strong>Of course I said YES!</strong><br> The story how my husban asked me to marry him is so funny and super cute, I love to tell it. I'm so happy
            for this decision, he is the man of my dreams and my life.<br> I would tell him yes again and again.</p>
