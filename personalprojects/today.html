        <p>Oh baby, I loved so so much this surprised. My first surprise was when you asked me to marry you, the best surprise of my life! I could belive it when you were there in the living room of my parents house, thanks babe to work hard to save money
            and visit me. I know you feel so tired sometimes and I feel so worry and sad for you every I hear you tired or when you had a bad day in the work, I would give whatever to make you feel better in those moments. I loved to be in the airb&b
            with you, I imagined how it would feel to have our own place and to have marriage life. I loved your food babe and I loved to watch you cook while we were talking or go to Walmart to buy food. Maybe the electricity ruins one night and it was
            chai but I enjoyed to have to be with you all the time. I loved to watch movies and series with you. Maybe you had to go earlier because the fetching COVID-19, it hurt me so much but I understood it was necessary for your welfare and your
            security. It was just 5 days but I really enjoyed them so much. No matter if it would be just a minute, being with you just that minute will make me so so happy for hours, days and months because I love you much more than I can write or say.
