        <p>This was the first time we date after long calls and a wonderful friendship. Eric decided to come to visit me and to try each other like something else. I'm so happy and grateful for all the effords he did that time to come to Merida as sooner
            as he could. I was overcoming some problems at that moment, so his visit made me feel happy again and to trust and love as well. We realized how much time we had wasted without each other. I started to love him so much since that day and my
            love for him has been growing up constantly till now. Eric is my angel and my most great <strong>miracle.</strong> I'm so so graful with God for the kind of man my sweet husband is. Thanks for supportme babe, let me dream and thanks for hearing
            me all the time.</p>
