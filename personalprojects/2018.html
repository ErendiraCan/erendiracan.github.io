        <p>My last day in the Mexico Chihuahua Mission: This day was the last time I watched you babe. I remember you wrote your email and your social media names in my agenda and I wrote mine in yours. I did't know you would be my husband, we sent some
            mails after this day and when you came back home we started to talk by messenger. I'm a little sad because I would have liked dating with you from the beginning, maybe now I would be with you, but I know God prepared the best moment to cross
            our paths and I loved they way He did it. I'm never going to forget this day!</p>
