        <p>We were in the same district in Jimenez Chihuahua, it isn't the first time we see each other. The first time was in Cuauhtemoc Chihuahua in a meeting with Elder Pieper. You were my district leader and in that moment a wonderful friend. Since that
            moment and after met you better I realized you were funny and so good giving advices, I remember when you talked with Elder Fuentes about how to flirt with girls. I will never forget too when we sang for Ayala and Santizo in their last day
            in the Mission, it was funny and cute, I really enjoyed so much to be in your district babe and you looked so handsome like a missionary, I always thought that, but I wasn't able to tell you in that moment. I'm so so lucky to met you in that
            moment and to have the opportunity to be in the:<br>DAGGERS DISTRICT</p>
