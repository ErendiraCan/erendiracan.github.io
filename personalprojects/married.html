        <p>I loved the day we got married. I remember to be able to get married here in Merida you had to send your documents and then I had to translate them and take them to the civil office. For a while we tought we wouldn't do it, because the time, the
            distance and the money, we felt a little sad because those things but we prayed and thanks God all worked for us. We were able to do all in less than a month and then we got married. We had to make our blood test the same day our photo session
            and we had to do all very quickly. Thanks for waiting me two times babe, while a woman was making me up, I know it was super boring and you had to wait for our photo session and then for our wedding day. Thanks my love for that wonderful week,
            I enjoyed so much our little honeymoon after our civil wedding. Thanks for love me babe, for love my country, my culture, the food of my city, my family and relatives, thanks for trying hard to improve your Spanish, and thanks for accept to
            wear this kind of shirt, because it's part of my place. Thanks for working hard to make this possible love, I admire you so much and I'm so proud of you, my wonderful husband.</p>
