        <p>We were in the same district in Jimenez Chihuahua, it isn't the first time we see each other. the first time were in Cuauhtemoc Chihuahua in a meeting with Elder Pieper. He was my district leader and in that moment a wonderful friend. I'm so so
            lucky to met him in that moment and to have the opportunity to be in that district:<br> THE DAGGERS</p>
