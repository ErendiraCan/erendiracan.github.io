        <p>I don't have a business yet but currently my mom and my sister are thinking to sell cakes and other sugar treats. <br> In my ward they are so know because their desserts are so delicious. So after this pandemic passes, we want to start a little
            business selling cakes and desserts using a website or just taking orders by phone. We are going to sell them for a good price of course with the best quality</p>
        <h2>What kind of desserts are we going to sell?</h2>
        <p>For the moment just cakes, brownies, cookies and cupcakes in all their flavors, colors and shapes!</p>
        <h2>How will be the orders?</h2>
        <p>We want to start just doing orders of maximum 20 cookies, brownies or cupcakes.</p>
