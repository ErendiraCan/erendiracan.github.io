            <h2>Enjoy the Beauty of Cozumel!</h2>
            <p>The Caribbean sea is completely fascinating. 
                The turquoise of its waters and its transparency will make you fall in love of this scene. 
                If you are thinking about visiting the Riviera Maya, you definitely have to enjoy a few days in Cozumel. 
                To get there you will have to take a flight to Cancún and then, take the ferry to this enchanted place.
                The island has incomparable views, in and outside the water. 
                It is one of the favorite destinations for doing snorkel thanks to the fact that it is 
                part of the second largest reef barrier in the world.</p>
