                <h3>El Cielo</h3>
                <p>Imagine immersing yourself in the middle of the crystal clear waters of the Riviera Maya and find out that the sky can also be under the sea. 
                    How is that possible? Well, if you take a boat ride to surround this wonderful island, it will take you to El Cielo beach where this peculiar natural phenomenon takes place.
                    In addition to having crystal clear waters and very fine white sand starfish can usually be found. 
                    When you submerge yourself you will feel as if you have the sky under your feet with a -literally- starry seabed.</p>
                <p>It’s important to do these routes with a certified guide and be especially careful not to touch this specie and also not to take it out of the water because, 
                    in a few minutes, it could die and the ecosystem will be severely affected.</p>
                <p>Thanks to the tranquility of the sea and its lack of waves, this place becomes one of the favorites to snorkel. 
                    If you look closely, it is possible to find stingrays that will swim close to you, but be careful not to disturb them or to step on them, 
                    this way you can help to preserve the natural landscape and local fauna.</p>
                <p>Take advantage of the day by getting relaxed and lying down under the sun to forget about the routine. The tour lasts 30 minutes by boat on the open sea.</p>

                    While you go through the area, imagine how the life of the Mayan people wouldhad been, 
                    try to imagine their every day activities and they religious ceremonies.</p>
                <p>The Arco of San Gervasio in Cozumel is one of the most visited places of this archaeological area because it is very similar to the ones that are in Chichén Itzá, Kabáh or Labná. 
                    If you are looking for the strongest connection with nature you can head for La Casa Alta or Ka Nah and visit the cenote there.</p>
