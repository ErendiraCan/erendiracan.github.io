        <h2>Challenge One: Todo</h2>
        <p><u>Build a simple web app to manage a ToDo list.</u></p>
        <p>I don't know where to start. It was a true challenge for me. I don't know why JavaScript is much more difficult to understand than Java.
            I spent a lot of time figuring out how to do it, I look tutorial on the internet, some videos, some readings, I reviewed the book as well looking for answers or to give me an idea 
            about how to do it. I think the most challenging was the Local Storage and the Task Filter function. I didn't know how to do the local storage part.
            The internet is full of different ways to do it and work with it. I felt overwhelmed but I didn't give up.
        </p>
        <p>At the beginning I started my code without a form tag and I added onclick events to all my buttons, so my HTML looked like this:</p>
        <img src="../images/html-image.png" alt="HTML image">
        <p>I didn't know how importand would be to use the form tag. I started with the simplest, how to add the new task, at the beggining I used the created element and appendchild methods it worked 
            but it made my life more difficult after. After seeing some tuturials I dicided to use another way to create the new task, in a tutorial I found they suggested to create the 
            string concatenating all the values to create the HTML tags and atrributes.
        </p>
        <p>After the most difficult would be the Local Storage and the task filter, at the beginning this was my filter idea, using the HTML above and my first JS code:</p>
        <img src="../images/filter-js-image.png" alt="Task Filter JS image">
        <p>It worked in a way but the true challenge would be the Local Storage, I spent a lot of time how to do it, that's why I started to look on internet several
            tutorials, suggestions, advices and everything that could help me until I found one that helped me a lot but I had to change almost all of my code.
            I have I was able to finish it, with some help the internet provided me, I didn't know if for this activity we had the possibility to ask for help
            to my peers so I didn't. I don't know how they did it and if for they it was a challenge or an easy task, I will asked them after I received my proper grade.
