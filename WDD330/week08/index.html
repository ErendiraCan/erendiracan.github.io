        <h2>Notes about the reading</h2>
        <!--Chapter 8-->
        <p><u>Reading: HTML5 & CSS3 For the Real World Chapter 8 - CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</u></p>
        <p>The CSS3 transform property lets us translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. 
            The order of transform functions does matter, we need to be careful about the order.</p>
        <p>The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top: transform: translate(45px, -45px);<br>
            To mimic translation we can use position: relative;, and top and left values.
        </p>
        <p>The scale(x,y) function scales an elementbythe defined factors horizontally then vertically: transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);<br>
            We can also mimic the scale function by altering the width and height, or changing the font-size of an element but this can change the layout.
        </p>
        <p>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.</p>
        <p>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes: transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);</p>
        <p>We can control the origin from which our transforms are applied using the transform-origin property: transform-origin: 10% 10%; (top or center).</p>
        <p>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: transition-duration: 0.2s;</p>
        <p>The transition-timing-function lets us control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail. It can be slower or faster graduality:<br>
            transition-timing-function: ease; (linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out.)
        </p>
        <p>We can combine all the values of the transition properties in a single declaration: transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;</p>
        <p>We can use a keyframe to include the properties we want to animate, along with the animated values.</p>
        <p>Animation properties: animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, 
            animation-delay, animation-fill-mode and animation-play-state.<br>
            Like the transition properties there is a shorthand for animation properties too: animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;
        </p>
        <!--Chapter 12-->
        <p><u>Reading: HTML5 & CSS3 For the Real World Chapter 12 - Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</u></p>
        <p>With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine using JavaScript. This avoides the need to download images off the network</p>
        <p>We can animate our SVG figures using Raphaël that has animation features built in with the animate method</p>
        <p>Canvas allows for pixel manipulation, it's faster because there’s also no access to what’s drawn on the canvas via the DOM.
            It's a good idea if our goal is to design a game that requires lots of animations.</p>
        <p>In SVG we can accessible to our draws via the DOM, SVG has a more complete set of tools to help us work with it, 
            such as the Raphaël library and Inkscape. SVG is a file format, we can't draw on a surface and manipulate SVG images.</p>
        <p>The Drag and Drop API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable
            elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.</p>
