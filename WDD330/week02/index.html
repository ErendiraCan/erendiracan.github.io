        <h2>Notes about the reading</h2>
        <p><u>Reading:</u><br>
        The three chapters are basically the base of the Javascript language. I didn't know what words we can't use to name a variable, in the book there is a list of those forbidden words that can create errors or exceptions inside the code.<br>
        The template literals were something new as well, I always use the quotation marks "" but I didn't know I can mix both. The ninja Quiz at the end of the chapters was a good example to check code about all the chapters were talking about.<br>
        I didn't know the methods of mixing arrays, so the book has some good examples about it. I think these chapters were an important reminder about what all I already know about Javascript, stuff I have forgotten or those things I didn't know.<br>
        I think what was helped me to remember and put in practice those concepts was the team meeting. One of my peers already works in web development so his experience is so beneficial and useful. Practically he answered all my questions.<br>
        He showed us all the differences between the different ways we can declare a function and other information about Javascript.<br>
        This week activity was simple and maybe easy but it was a wonderful exercise to remember the most important points about Javascript. I know every week the difficulty level will increase until the final project that it will be individually,
        but I think that's the reason of these team activities. Personally I like them because alone sometimes is difficult to understand some parts of a code but together like a team, everyone can give their point of view and thoughts.
        </p>
        <h2>Question:</h2>
        <p>When we can use the other ways to declare a function? I use the common way the function Name(){}; but I know there are other ways to do so, but when, where and why can use them?</p>
