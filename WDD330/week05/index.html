        <h2>Notes about the reading</h2>
        <p><u>Reading: JavaScript-Novice to Ninja Chapter: 10 Testing and Debugging</u></p>
        <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>
        <p>A stack trace is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</p>
        <p>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t enough to cause the program to crash.</p>
        <p>To use the strict mode you only need the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file: 'use strict';<br>
            ES6 introduced JavaScript modules. These are self contained pieces of code that are in strict mode by default, so the 'use strict'
            declaration is not required.
        </p>
        <p>Linting tools such as JS Lint,1 JS Hint,2 and ES Lint3 can be used to test the
            quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode.<br>
            They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain 
            if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented.
            They are useful for enforcing a programming style guide if we are working with a team.
        </p>
        <p>Breakpoints are useful if we are debugging in a browser, this halt the progress of the
            code and allow us to view the value of different variables at that point in the program.
        </p>
        <p>Console object that provides a number of methods for logging information and debugging for example the famous console.log() statements.</p>
        <p>One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword.  This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution 
            of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to. The only thing is we need to remember delete the this command when we
            finish all our code because if we don't the program will appear to freeze when people try to use it.
        </p>
        <p>We can create error objects, they can be created in the code using a constructor function:<br>
            There are seven more error objects used for specific errors (Check the book for more specifications):
            EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError and InternalError.<br>
            All error objects have a number of properties, the properties that are generally safe to use are:
            Name, message and stack.
        </p>
        <p>It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement. This will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted
            and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background.</p>
        <p>When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. We can handle an error with three important steps:<br>
            try, catch, and finally.
        </p>
        <p>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it should.</p>
        <p>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code.<br>
            These are the steps we need to follow: Write tests (that initially fail), Write code to pass the tests, Refactor the code,
            Test refactored code and Write more tests for new features.
        </p>
        <p>TDD frameworks: Jest. We can install it using npm.</p>
        <h2>Code excersise:</h2>
        <p>Ninja Quiz. I wrote comments in the JS files.</p>
        <a href="activity.html">Chapter10: Testing and Debugging</a><br>
        <h2>Question:</h2>
        <p>What could be the best way or practice to debug my code? I read a lot of wonderful examples and ways, until now I just have used the console in a browser
            but I would like to know the most common or the easier to use.
