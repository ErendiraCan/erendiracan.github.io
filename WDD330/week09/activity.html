        <h2>My reading notes about this chapter</h2>
            <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and
                methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</p>
            <p>The BOM only makes sense in a browser environment. Node.js doesn't have this kind of environment but it has an object called global.</p>
            <p>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. These variables are created without using the const, let or var
                keywords.</p>
            <p>Dialogs in the browsers: alert(), confirm() and prompt().</p>
            <p>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. 
                The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used.</p>
            <p>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page</p>
            <p>The window.history property can be used to access information about any
                previously visited pages in the current browser session.</p>
            <p>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method.</p>
            <p>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on.
                The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the screen.
            </p>
            <p>The write() DOM method simply writes a string of text to the page.</p>
            <p>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. A restriction of cookies is that they can only be read by a web page from the same
                domain that set them.</p>
            <p>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s 'cookie jar', using the document.cookie property: document.cookie = 'name=Superman';</p>
            <p>Cookies are session cookies by default. This means they are deleted once a browser session is finished but we can make Cookies persistent adding: "; expires=date"</p>
