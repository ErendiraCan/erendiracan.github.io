        <h2>Notes about the reading</h2>
        <p><u>Reading:</u><br>
        It is the first time I see objects in JavaScript. I think what I did for my portfolio is a kind of object. I would like to remember some important points I learned in these chapters.
        I can create an empty object with this const constname = {}; or with const constname = new Object(); <br>
        I can call a method by these two ways: objectname.method() or objectname['method']() <br>
        I can check if there’s a property inside an object 'property' with objectname or if it’s undefined with the objectname.property !== undefined;<br>
        It’s possible to nest objects.<br>
        Parse() can take a string from a JSON file to create and object in JavaScript and the stringify() method does the opposite.<br>
        The Math.abs() method returns the absolute value of a number, no matter if it’s positive or negative.<br>
        Math.ceil, floor, round, trunc, pow and random I already know them, but I put them here to remember they exist.<br>
        Sqrt is the abbreviation of square root. Negative numbers return NaN.<br>
        Cbrt is the cube root abbreviation. Hypot is the square root of the sum of the squares of all its arguments, it can calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.<br>
        Math.max or min is the maximum or minimum number from its arguments. In 1,2,3 three would be the max.<br>
        I already used the new Date(); and I didn’t know it was an object or I didn’t understand it in that way. Also I didn’t know getDate, Month, Fullyear, etc. were methods.<br>
        There are some methods I think are use in scientific codes or to calculate more specific stuff, I just reviewed and checked them.<br>
        The getElementById, getElementByTagName, getElementsByClassName and querySelector are methods.<br>
        setAttribute is to change the class name of an element.<br>
        The addEventListener can be called on a node object or without one. I liked too how this method is used in the examples to interact inside a website, like with the click, mousedown and mouseup.<br>

        <p>I save this image to remember what a DOM (Document Object Model) is:<br>

        <h2>Code excersise:</h2>
        <p>I did it before my team meeting so, I had to see the solution because I was stucked </p>
        <h2>Question:</h2>
        <p>When we can use the The Math.log() method? I understand it returns the natural logarithm of a number but in what kind of situation it would be useful?</p>
