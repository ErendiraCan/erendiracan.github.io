        <h2>Notes about the reading</h2>
        <p><u>Reading: JavaScript-Novice to Ninja Chapter: 11 Further Functions</u></p>
        <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of THIS inside a function to an
            object that is provided as the first argument: functionName.call()<br>
            The apply() method works in the same way: functionName.apply()</p>
        <p>If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a cache property: functionName.cache = functionName.cache || {};</p>
        <p>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE (pronounced “iffy”) – is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined.<br>
            I can use strict mode but I have to place all the code inside the IIFE to avoid problems.</p>
        <p>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself; assigning an
            anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.</p>
        <p>Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming. This means that the code is able to run out of order.<br>
            Using more and more callbacks in the same function can result in messy and confusing “spaghetti code”, this is a large number of nested blocks that are difficult to
            comprehend. Callback hell is the term used to refer to this tangled mess of code. A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation.<br>
            The Promise Life Cycle: First is created, it calls an asynchronous operation:is pending, the operation take its place:is unsettled, the operation is completed:is settled and finally can
            result in resolved or rejected.
        </p>
        <p>A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function, maintaining access to any variables declared inside the enclosing function.</p>
        <p>Currying is a process that involves the partial application of functions. Currying allows us to turn a single function into a series of functions instead.</p>
        <p><u>Reading: JavaScript-Novice to Ninja Chapter: 13 AJAX</u></p>
        <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.</p>
        <p>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch.<br>
            Fetch API uses promises to avoid callback hell, and also streamlines a number of concepts that had become cumbersome when using the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>
        <p>The redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL.<br>
            The text() method takes a stream of text from the response: it can be a string in JavaScript<br>
            The blob() method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet.<br>
            The json() method is the most common in AJAX an is used to deal with responses by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.<br>
            The Request() constructor let us create an object like an argument to get fine-grained control over the request. The objects we can create are: URL, method, headers, mode, cache, 
            credentials and redirect.
