        <h2>Notes about the video and the reading:</h2>
        <p><u>Reading:</u><br>
        In the reading the author taught us how to save the user info using localStorage. He used three functions: one to load the user information, one to save their info and another to display it.
        He used two variables one for the name of the story and the second variable for all the story text.<br>
        In the first function to LOAD, he uses the localStorage to get an item stored with a specific value name. For example if my story name is "The Blue Bird" the getItem will look for a variable (storyName) with the value "The Blue Bird" and after for the
        storyHTML variable, in this case the Blue bird story text.<br>
        The SAVE function uses the localStorage plus the setItem to save the name and the text of a story, in this case to save my Blue Bird story.<br>
        The DISPLAY function only uses the storyHTML variable to output the story already saved in the local storage.

        <p><u>Video:</u><br>
        It’s wiser to design and plan a web site first in a small screen view, in this case in phones view, because this makes all the work easier.
        There are 3 things we need to have in mind when we design an application: "Be there, be useful, be quick"<br>
        The design of a website matters. We have to have in mind that the most of the people uses more bottom of the screen rather than the top.<br>
        The speed of the application matters. It’s necessary to try to reduce the time it takes to load a page, this means we need to choose correctly images files, use web fonts, and reduce the most we can JS and CSS code.<br>
        The menu button needs to be in a visible and easy to use place. The hamburger button sometimes isn’t understood it by all the users, so studies showed it’s better to use the word "menu" inside a box like a the button instead of the common hamburger button.<br>
        It's vital to reduce the cognitive load. This means we need to reduce the effort of a user takes filling a form to buy or enter to their account and any kind of interaction inside the application.<br>
        We can reduce the stress a user feels using an application if we use the correct tools, for example: In a form if they only need to use numbers to introduce its phone number, instead to bring the classic phone keyboard, we just could bring a number keyboard.<br>
        The last important thing I learned was, to avoid using pop-ups/pop-overs. Trying not to make the advertisement takes all the place of the screen because this could make the user abandons the website or the application.

        <h2>Question:</h2>
        <p>This is about the reading: Why does the last function (displayStory) only use one variable? And why is it storyHTML?<br> 
        I would use the storyName variable like an idex to find it easier and the I would add the storyHTML just to display the text with the title.</p>
